        We want to solve a Laplace equation: Î”phi= 0 over the cage where phi is a scalar function. 
        This is the harmonic functions and we discretize them into a linear system using: 
        - L : cotan weight laplacian matrix 
        - M: mass matrix

        we then solve A = M_inv @ L --> A @ (PHI_MATRIX) = 0

        - partition A into constrained (cage boundary) points and free (interior cage) points

        Boils down to : Afc @ phi_constrained + Aff @ phi_free =0
